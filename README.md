# Skin Disease Image Synthesis

## Overview

This project aims to generate synthetic images of skin diseases using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By creating additional samples from an existing dataset, the goal is to expand the dataset size, enhance class balancing, and improve the performance of machine learning models used for skin disease diagnosis.

## Motivation

- **Class Imbalance**: Medical datasets often suffer from class imbalance, where certain diseases have significantly fewer samples than others. This imbalance can lead to biased models that perform poorly on underrepresented classes.
- **Data Augmentation**: Synthetic data generation helps augment the dataset, creating more samples for rare classes, improving the generalization of machine learning models.
- **Medical Research**: Enhanced datasets contribute to better diagnostic tools, aiding in accurate and early diagnosis of skin diseases.

## Features

- **Image Generation**: Generate high-quality synthetic images of various skin diseases.
- **Class Balancing**: Address class imbalance by producing more samples for underrepresented classes.
- **GAN Model**: Use GANs to learn the underlying distribution of the dataset and generate realistic images.

## Methodology

1. **Dataset Preparation**: The existing dataset of skin disease images is preprocessed and split into training and validation sets.
2. **GAN Architecture**: 
   - The GAN consists of a Generator and a Discriminator network.
   - The Generator learns to create realistic images, while the Discriminator learns to distinguish between real and synthetic images.
3. **Training**: 
   - The GAN model is trained on the dataset, adjusting weights to improve image quality over multiple epochs.
   - Losses for the Generator and Discriminator are minimized using adversarial training.
4. **Evaluation**: 
   - The quality of generated images is evaluated using visual inspection and quantitative metrics to ensure realistic representation.
   - Generated images are compared against real images to assess model performance.
